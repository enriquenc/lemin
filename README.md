The goal of this project is to find the quickest way to get N ants across the farm.


Obviously, there are some basic constraints. To be the first to arrive, ants will need
to take the shortest path (and that isnâ€™t necessarily the simplest). They will also
need to avoid traffic jams as well as walking all over their fellow ants.


At the beginning of the game, all the ants are in the room ##start. The goal is
to bring them to the room ##end with as few turns as possible. Each room can
only contain one ant at a time. (except at ##start and ##end which can contain
as many ants as necessary.) All the ants are in the room ##start at the beginning of the game.
